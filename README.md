# Udacity - Nanodegree Program Project Repository

This is the collective repository for all my Udacity Nanodegree web projects.</br> 
Projects in here are the final submissions for the course or any personal projects created while taking the course.</br> 
The goal of these projects are to showcase my understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in handmade web content.</br>  

Here are links to the Udacity Nanodegree Programs:
