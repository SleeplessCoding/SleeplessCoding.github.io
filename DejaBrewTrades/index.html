                <p>
                    I have been trading for six years. 
                    I started off using paper trading apps on my iPhone when I was in high school. 
                    Once I began to understand what I was doing I was able to turn a massive profit in my paper trading sims. 
                    The problem was the knowledge I acquired did not come easy. 
                    I searched everywhere I could online for high-quality content that didn't seem like a scam and wouldn't cost me thousands of dollars. 
                    Unfortunately, this type of content was hard to find. 
                    Once I got tired of searching online I began to hunt down the best trading books I could find. 
                    After reading book after book I began to see a massive improvement in my trading. 
                    I now understood how to be profitable and all I needed was a system that worked. I then began to create this system from scratch. 
                    After years of tweaking and testing, I finally have a strategy and trading system that is proven to be profitable. 
                    This course will go over everything you need to know to jump-start your trading, from beginner to expert. 
                    This course will also provide you with access to my proprietary trading strategies, indicators, and scanners. 
                    I will not only provide you the tools you need to be successful, I will teach you how to use them. 
                    I hope to guide you into becoming a profitable trader and help you obtain financial freedom.

                            I have been a member of Twitch since 2012. 
                            I started streaming sometime in 2013, but it was not trading related. 
                            I had a small following, but due to work and school, I had to stop streaming. 
                            I restarted my stream on January 1st, 2018 when Twitch created a Crypto trading section. 
                            I instantly received amazing feedback from my viewers and quickly obtained my sub button. 
                            Within a month I was averaging over 60 viewers a stream with over a hundred subs. 
                            The community was strong. After the hype of the new "crypto section" died down and bitcoin began to tank, so did my viewership. 
                            But due to my continued effort to bring the greatest amount of value to the crypto section my channel has continued to grow. 
                            With almost a cult-like following and loyal fans, I have been able to make this my full-time job. 
                            The BrewCrew is one of the most dedicated and loyal communities on Twitch and we've only been around for a few months.<br>
